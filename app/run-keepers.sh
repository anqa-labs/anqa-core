#
# Quoting is owned by the resident daemon (app/maker-daemon.ts), a warm,
# oracle-driven engine that moves only the rungs that changed and manages
# inventory. The keeper's legacy spawn-a-maker-per-requote watchdog is disabled
# here (ANQA_NO_KEEPER_MAKER=1) so the two do not quote the same books.
#
# **One keeper drives every market in the hub**, and the plural in this
# script's name is history. There used to be one process per market, which was
# never buying isolation: everything that carries risk is hub-scoped — one risk
# engine, one asset-slot slab, one clock, one portfolio per trader — and only
# six accounts are actually per-market. So N processes ran the same full
# `getProgramAccounts` portfolio scan N times every fifteen seconds and spawned
# N makers at once, which is enough load on its own to exhaust a public RPC's
# connection limit, 429 the makers before they can read their own balance, and
# leave every book empty. Nine markets did exactly that on 2026-08-05.
#
# Markets come from ANQA_MARKETS ("id:asset:feed,…") or default to the hub's
# nine, so a hundred markets is a longer string, not a hundred processes.
